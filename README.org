* Distance
  We defined =Distance= between two nodes in a graph (as described in
  ref) as
  #+begin_src agda
    data Distance : Set where
	hop   : ℕ → Distance
	nohop :     Distance
  #+end_src
  in other words, two nodes are either connected trough a number of
  hops (=hop n=) or there is no known path between them (=nohop=).
** short-circuiting: choosing minimum distances
   We subsequently defined 2 operations on distance: join and meet.
   - join :: with the meaning that we could take either path from one
     node to another:
     #+begin_src agda
       _∨_ : Distance → Distance → Distance
	 hop x ∨ hop y = hop (min x y)
	 a ∨ nohop = a
	 nohop ∨ b = b
     #+end_src
   - meet :: with the intended menaing of actually join two path
     togeter (resulting in one big path)
     #+begin_src agda
       _∧_ : Distance → Distance → Distance
	 hop x ∧ hop y = hop (x + y)
	 a ∧ nohop = nohop
	 nohop ∧ b = nohop
     #+end_src
* Dioid
  With the latter definitions we are able to prove that the Distance
  between 2 nodes is an idempotent semiring with regards to the
  operations \(\vee\) (sum) and \(\wedge) (multiplication), and the
  respective neutral elements (=hop zero= and =nohop=).
